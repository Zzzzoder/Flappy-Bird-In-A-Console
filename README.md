# Flappy-Bird-In-A-Console
I challenged myself to make Flappy Bird in a standard Windows console.

**I also made the video series showing the process:**

## Controls:
**Enter** -> Restart game

**Up arrow** -> Flap

## Source code?
Currently, source code is a mess. I'll upload it once I clean up and optimize the code.

Also, this is my first time using Github. If I'm doing something wrong, please let me know.
